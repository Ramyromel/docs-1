# Deploy the ERC-6551 Registry

<Callout type="info">
  This guide covers the deployment of the ERC-6551 Registry contract for the
  purpose of interacting with TBAs (Tokenbound Accounts) on a local node OR if
  you want to enable TBAs for the first time on a new EVM chain. Otherwise, you
  may use the existing canonical ERC-6551 Registry contract.
</Callout>

The ERC-6551 Registry contract has already been deployed across several EVM networks. A list of deployed addresses can be found [here](/contracts/deployments).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Foundry">
    ```bash
    $ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    $ foundryup
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the Reference repository">
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/erc6551/reference.git
    ```

    <Callout type="danger">
    Make sure you checkout on `v0.3.1` tag for the repository

    This is ensures that the address of Registry contract is the same as on any other EVM compatible chain. The current address that’s deployed on all chains is: `0x000000006551c19487814612e58FE06813775758`

    </Callout>

    ```bash
    $ git checkout tags/v0.3.1
    ```

    <Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">

    If this address differs it would cause a tokenbound account associated with an NFT to have different addresses on different chains

    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the tests and build the contracts">
    ```bash
    $ forge test
    $ forge build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compute the Registry address">
    This is to make sure it matches with `0x000000006551c19487814612e58FE06813775758`

    ```bash
    $ forge script script/ComputeRegistryAddress.s.sol:ComputeRegistryAddress
    ```

    The output should be:

    ```bash ❯ forge script script/ComputeRegistryAddress.s.sol:ComputeRegistryAddress
    [⠒] Compiling... No files changed, compilation skipped Script ran successfully. Gas
    used: 24925

    == Logs ==
    0x000000006551c19487814612e58FE06813775758
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      make sure the Address matches with
      `0x000000006551c19487814612e58FE06813775758`
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy the Registry">
    Before we can deploy we need to provide `MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY` env variable - set this to your test account’s private key

    ```bash
    $ forge script --fork-url <RPC_URL> script/DeployRegistry.s.sol --broadcast
    ```

    Replace `<RPC_URL>` with your chain's RPC endpoint
  </Step>
